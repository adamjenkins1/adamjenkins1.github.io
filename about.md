<h2>About</h2>     
<ul>
<p>My name is Adam Jenkins, and I’m a third-year computer science major at CSU, Chico. When I’m not <a href="/projects.html" target="_blank">programming</a> (either for school or just for fun), I enjoy gaming, biking, skiing, and hanging out with my pets. In addition to older titles such as Oblivion and Skyrim, I also enjoy tabletop gaming with friends, especially if <a href="https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/eldritch-horror-showcase/" target="_blank">Eldritch Horror</a> is involved.</p>
<p>Outside of computers and/or gaming, I am a huge fan of my cats and dog, who, despite my attempt to take one of them with me, still live back in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pacifica,+CA/@37.6588244,-122.5950098,11z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x808f772fd14a9679:0x44b02f7f17a1c438!8m2!3d37.6138253!4d-122.4869194" target="_blank">Pacifica</a> with my parents and younger brother. I do also follow politics fairly closely, though the more I read, the more I like my pets.</p>
