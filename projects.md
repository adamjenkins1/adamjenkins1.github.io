<li><h2>TN Rotational Schedule</h2></li>
<p>The most recent project I've <!-- ' -->completed, excluding this website, is the rotational schedule mobile app I wrote for Terra Nova High School, located in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Terra+Nova+High+School/@37.6802822,-122.4596628,11z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x808f709c80d33127:0x118d2aa0ddff4e4b!8m2!3d37.5946419!4d-122.4761369" target="_blank">Pacifica, CA</a>. The app is now availble on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tn-rotational-schedule/id1135302983?ls=1&mt=8" target="_blank">App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adam.rotationalschedule&hl=en" target="_blank">Google Play</a>, free of charge.  The app is designed to aid students, parents, and staff providing an accurate and reliable source of information about the rotational schedule and class times. The code for both the <a href="http://github.com/adamjenkins1/ios-Rotational-Schedule-app" target="_blank">ios</a> and <a href="http://github.com/adamjenkins1/Rotational-Schedule-App">Android</a> versions are on Github.</p>
</ul>
