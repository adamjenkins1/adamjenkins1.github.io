<h2>Most Notable Projects</h2>     
<ul>
<h3 style="display:inline;">TN Rotational Schedule</h3>
<p>The most recent project I&rsquo;ve completed, excluding this website, is the rotational schedule mobile app I wrote for Terra Nova High School, located in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Terra+Nova+High+School/@37.6802822,-122.4596628,11z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x808f709c80d33127:0x118d2aa0ddff4e4b!8m2!3d37.5946419!4d-122.4761369" target="_blank">Pacifica, CA</a>. TN Rotational Schedule is now availble on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tn-rotational-schedule/id1135302983?ls=1&mt=8" target="_blank">App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adam.rotationalschedule&hl=en" target="_blank">Google Play</a>, free of charge.  The app is designed to aid students, parents, and staff by providing an accurate and reliable source of information about the rotational schedule and class times. The code for both the <a href="http://github.com/adamjenkins1/ios-Rotational-Schedule-app" target="_blank">iOS</a> and <a href="http://github.com/adamjenkins1/Rotational-Schedule-App">Android</a> versions can be found on Github.</p>
<h3 style="display:inline;">BBLeagues Basketball Database Project</h3>
<p>I completed this database in Spring 2016 while taking the databases course, CINS 370. BBLeagues was built using Oracle and contains a variety basketball related statistics. In order to better understand the data, we created our own .csv files from the data using PL/SQL, usually containing one or two statistics, and plotted said .csv files using R. After taking our findings to our professor, we were asked to present to the class. The presentation I built using LaTeX and presented can be found <a href="Data/media/pdf/main.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
