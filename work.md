<h3 style="display:inline;"><a href="http://www.llnl.gov/" target="_blank">Lawrence Livermore National Lab</a> - Computation Intern</h3> 
<h4 style="display:inline; float:right;">January - August 2017</h4>
<p>After completing the Fall semester in 2016, I was hired for a co-op internship at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. 
While at the lab, I primarily worked on two web applications: the Student Poster Grading Application (SPGA) and the Java Cafe Replacement Application.
Every year at the Annual Student Poster Symposium, faculty used to grade student posters by hand and requested a website to make the process a bit easier. 
My job for this project was to redesigned the existing JavaEE application to use the Java Play Framework and AngularJS 
and also make design changes to improve user experience. I worked closely with my mentor and the other clients to ensure that the 
application met the users' needs and also implement any changes they proposed to improve functionality. This was my first major
web application, so it was a great opprotunity to learn how to implement a website backend that worked together 
with the adaptive frontend built with AngularJS.  During the Annual Student Poster Symposium, SPGA was used by faculty members to grade
several hundred posters and deliver concise and human readable results in the form of an Excel spreadsheet. The Java Cafe Replacement Application was meant 
to do what it's name suggests: replace Java Cafe.  Java Cafe is an old Java web framework and I was tasked with replacing it with a 
Java Play/Angular 2 application. By the end of my internship, I had completed the first screen which allowed users to 
alter which employees worked on which tasks. This project has since been passed on to other employees to complete.

<h3 style="display:inline;"><a href="http://www.csuchico.edu" target="_blank">CSU, Chico</a> - Lab Assistant</h3> 
<h4 style="display:inline; float:right;">August 2016 - Present</h4>
<p>I am currently working as a lab assistant in the Butte Hall computer labs on campus. 
My primary task is to open the labs for students and faculty to use and resolve any technical issues 
that may arise. Ocassionaly this means helping professors learn how to better use the technology we have, 
but more often, I spend the majority of my time maintaining and repairing all of the computers in the labs. 
However, there are multiple side jobs that my supervisor brings to me when faculty have more complex problems. 
For example, this included replacing a faculty member's iPad screen. I also designed a new form for the 
tutoring labs that allows professors to track how long students spend in the tutoring labs, the purpose for their visit, 
and multiple other fields. This form replaced the previous Microsoft Access form that both students and faculty had trouble using. 
Professors can also download all of the data as a .csv and conduct their own analysis if they wish.</p>

<h4 style="display:inline; float:right;">Summer 2015</h4>
<p>During the summer of 2015, I was an intern at Jewish LearningWorks 
(previously known as the Bureau of Jewish Education), 
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Jewish+LearningWorks/@37.7760083,-122.4731152,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x3d00aeefab06495b!8m2!3d37.7760083!4d-122.4731152" target="_blank">located</a> 
in the Richmond district in San Francisco. My primary goal was to assist in migrating content from 
their old website hosted by soapbox, to their new website hosted by Squarespace. I also worked with the 
graphic designer to properly display content using IFrames as well as adding visual content to the new website. 
On my free time, I taught myself the basics of Javascript using <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">codecademy</a>.</p>
