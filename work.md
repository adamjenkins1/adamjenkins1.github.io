<h3 style="display:inline;">Lab Assistant, <a href="http://www.csuchico.edu" target="_blank">CSU, Chico</a></h3> 
<h4 style="display:inline; float:right;">August 2016 - Present</h4>
<p>I am currently working as a lab assistant in the Butte Hall computer labs on campus. My primary task is to open the labs for students and faculty to use and resolve any technical issues that may arise. Ocassionaly this means helping professors learn how to better use the technology we have, but more often, I spend the majority of my time maintaining and repairing all of the computers in the labs. However, there are multiple side jobs that my supervisor brings to me when faculty have more complex problems. For example, this included replacing a faculty member&rsquo;s iPad screen. I also designed a new form for the tutoring labs that allows professors to track how long students spend in the tutoring labs, the purpose for their visit, and multiple other fields. This form replaced the previous Microsoft Access form that both students and faculty had trouble using. Professors can also download all of the data as a .csv and conduct their own analysis if they wish.</p>

<p>During the summer of 2015, I was an intern at Jewish LearningWorks (previously known as the Bureau of Jewish Education), <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Jewish+LearningWorks/@37.7760083,-122.4731152,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x3d00aeefab06495b!8m2!3d37.7760083!4d-122.4731152" target="_blank">located</a> in the Richmond district in San Francisco. My primary goal was to assist in moving content from their old website hosted by soapbox, to their new website hosted by Squarespace. I also worked with the graphic designer to properly display content using IFrames as well as adding visual content to the new website. On my free time, I taught myself the basics of Javascript using <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">codecademy</a>.</p>
